      <article>We met up with my husband's side of the family and took a trip for a few days to the beach. We stayed in San Clemente, about 7 mins from the beach. We had so much fun relaxing and doing all the beach things we could. Hanging out in the morning at low tide to look for shells and pretty rocks was a must. Wish we had a week to spend there and take it all in.  </article>

      <article>We went back to hang out with family for the last two days of our trip. It was a mixture of enjoying the moments we had, mixed with the dread of leaving and not know when we'd be back. This was one of the best trips we had been on, it was all about the family and not trying to juggle too much this time around.  </article>
